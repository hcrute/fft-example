fft_example
===========

###Description
Takes in data, and calculates the dft using fft algorithm from fftw. Times how fast it takes to complete the computations. Prints out any number of maximum magnitues found, as well as what frequency they were at (only for the first window, and you must change the sampling frequency in fftlib.h if you have different data).
###Usage
./fft data.txt
###Requirements
ffw3.3+ library
